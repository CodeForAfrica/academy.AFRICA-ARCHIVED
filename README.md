[Github pages](https://pages.github.com/) + [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) powered micro-site for [academy.AFRICA](https://academy.africa/).


## Introduction

Journalism is evolving so quickly that newsrooms are struggling to keep up.

[academy.AFRICA](https://academy.africa/) seeks to help, by bringing face-to-face training into partner newsrooms across Africa, and by hosting public workshops at monthly [Hacks/Hackers meetups](https://facebook.com/HacksHackersAfrica).

The academy will also offer [online courses](https://courses.academy.africa/) and webinars, designed to teach just one tool or technique at a time, so participants can upgrade their skills at their own pace.

The training will be spearheaded by the continentâ€™s largest digital journalism network, [Code for Africa](https://codeforafrica.org/), with support from [Google News Lab]() and [World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org)'s [Global Media Development Programme](https://blogs.worldbank.org/category/tags/media-development).
